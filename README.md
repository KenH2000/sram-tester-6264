This program was written based on a ROM reader written by Oddbloke(16th Feb 2014).  It was intended to be able to write to, and read back the contents of a 6264 RAM to test it.  Although it appears to read and write the data, when verified with a device designed for testing SRAMs, the data written is not 100% correct.  The program reliably reads 2764 ROMs.  The reliability issue with SRAM may be related to the SRAM operating at CMOS/NMOS logic levels, vs. the ROM operating at TTL logic levels.
